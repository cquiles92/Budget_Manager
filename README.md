This is a simple console program that has an interactive menu that can keep track of certain expendetures. The program can save and load any input given into the given program and is a simple excercise to show off some OOP designs. The objects "Expense" allow the program to keep track of the name and expenditure as well as to give it a type with an enum. When a particular type of list is needed, the program creates smaller lists based off filtering using the Stream API to filter the enum type of the given expenditure. The program is also able to calculate based off the intitial income if it is possible to make certain expenditures.
